## Introduction

Hank The Hanging Man is a game made for educational purposes for my third portfolio project in software development that I am studying with the [Code Institute](https://www.codeinstitute.net/). It is aimed at people who want to have fun, test their knowledge, and also train their brain.

The project is generally a game of hangman but to make the game more interesting and appealing than the typical game of hangman people are used to playing, I added a story narrative to enhance the users experience. While designing this game I wanted my target audience to be users of all levels of intelligence so I added three different difficulty levels so that every user could have an enjoyable experience without finding the game either too challenging, or too easy. I wanted to also create a game that the user would want to return to, and play again so I designed it in a way that some of the statements would change every time the game is played to avoid repetition. 

I have applied the the technologies I have learnt so far in python to create my game. Other technologies used are listed in the technologies used section further down the page.
